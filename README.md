   - Supported formats: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WMV

### Simple Usage

**Option 1: Interactive Quick Start**
```bash
python quick_start.py
```

**Option 2: Command Line**
```bash
# Basic analysis
python script.py --video ./media/video_1.mp4

# Full analysis with visualizations
python script.py --video ./media/video_1.mp4 --visualize

# Complete analysis with video output
python script.py --video ./media/video_1.mp4 --visualize --save-video
```

## üìä Output Files

After analysis, you'll find results in the `./output/` directory:

### Analysis Results
- `analysis/analysis_results.json` - Complete analysis data
- `statistics/player_statistics.csv` - Player stats in CSV format

### Visualizations (when `--visualize` is used)

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### RTX 3050 Specific Settings
- **GPU Memory**: Configured for 80% usage (20% reserved for system)
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized batch size of 4
- **Half Precision**: FP16 enabled for better performance
- **CUDA Optimization**: Benchmark mode enabled

### Performance Tips
1. **Close unnecessary applications** while running analysis
2. **Use SSD storage** for video files if possible
3. **Monitor GPU temperature** during long analyses
4. **Consider lower resolution videos** for faster processing

## üîß Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

```python
# Detection thresholds
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.4
IOU_THRESHOLD = 0.5

# Court zones (modify for different court layouts)
COURT_ZONES = {
    "paint_left": (0.078, 0.278, 0.313, 0.722),
    # ... other zones
}

# Performance settings
BATCH_SIZE = 4  # Increase for more powerful GPUs
GPU_MEMORY_FRACTION = 0.8  # Adjust based on available memory
```

## üìà Understanding the Analysis

### Player Metrics
- **Shooting Percentage**: Made shots / Attempted shots √ó 100
- **Ball Touches**: Number of times player had ball possession
- **Distance Covered**: Total movement distance in pixels
- **Average Speed**: Movement speed in pixels per second
- **Zone Time**: Seconds spent in each court area

### Play Style Classification
- **Post Player/Center**: High paint area usage (>40%)
- **Perimeter Shooter**: High three-point area usage (>30%)
- **Point Guard/Playmaker**: High mobility (speed >200 px/s)
- **Mid-Range Specialist**: High mid-court usage (>40%)
- **Versatile Player**: Balanced across multiple areas

### Team Analytics
- **Possession Changes**: Estimated ball possession transfers
- **Fast Breaks**: Quick transition plays detected
- **Zone Popularity**: Most contested court areas
- **Game Pace**: High/Moderate based on player activity

## üéØ Advanced Usage

### Custom Model Training
If you have your own basketball dataset:

```bash
# Train custom YOLO model
yolo detect train data=./dataset/basketball/data.yaml model=yolo11n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640

# Use trained model
python script.py --video video.mp4 --model ./runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt
```

### Batch Processing
Process multiple videos:

```python
import glob
from basketball_analyzer import BasketballAnalyzer

analyzer = BasketballAnalyzer()
for video_path in glob.glob("./media/*.mp4"):
    results = analyzer.process_video(video_path)
    print(f"Processed: {video_path}")
```

### Custom Analysis
Extend the system with custom metrics:

```python
class CustomAnalyzer(BasketballAnalyzer):
    def custom_metric(self, player_stats):
        # Your custom analysis logic
        return analysis_results
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA Out of Memory**
   - Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` in `config.py`
   - Reduce `GPU_MEMORY_FRACTION`
   - Close other GPU-using applications

2. **Model Not Found**
   - Verify model paths in `config.py`
   - Download models to correct directories
   - Check file permissions

3. **Slow Performance**
   - Ensure CUDA is properly installed
   - Check GPU utilization with `nvidia-smi`
   - Consider using smaller video resolution

4. **No Players Detected**
   - Lower `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`
   - Check video quality and lighting
   - Verify custom model is basketball-specific

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor GPU usage
nvidia-smi -l 1

# Check Python process
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```
